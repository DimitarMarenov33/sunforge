mudrvd8,devdotm,"Except the sun is also really beneficial for cardiovascular health amongst others… 

“Sun exposure has additional effects apart from vitamin D production such as an effect on systemic inflammation, immunomodulation, melatonin system, nitric oxide, and calcium transport.” 

“Daily short sun exposure, at mid-day, without the use of sunscreens, might be optimal for health. Fair individuals need less sun exposure than those with more pigmented skin (15). A too restrictive sun exposure advice might do more harm than good by increasing the risk of death due to other diseases such as myocardial infarction and stroke”

Both of these are direct quotes from this 2022 lit review: https://ar.iiarjournals.org/content/42/4/1671 which concluded, “There seem to be an inverse association between sun exposure and hypertension, T2DM, venous thromboembolism, CVD, and cancer prognosis. All of these effects might explain the inverse association between sun exposure and all-cause mortality. Both vitamin D and NO seem to be major contributors to the above effects.”

Also check out this 2016 study of almost 30,000 Swedish women: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26992108/ 
The researchers found that “Nonsmokers who avoided sun exposure had a life expectancy similar to smokers in the highest sun exposure group, indicating that avoidance of sun exposure is a risk factor for death of a similar magnitude as smoking.”

I can see their point. It is way more likely to get osteoporosis than a melanoma. Most skin cancers are basal-cell or squamous cell carcinoma - which are super UNLIKELY to spread or cause deaths, and are easily treatable, without chemo. On the other hand, osteoporosis is widespread and hard to treat. Hip fractures are common in older women because of it, and 25% of people who have an hip fracture will die in the next year. 

As everything in life, it's all about BALANCE. I don't think any studies have proven that casual 'regular' sunscreen wear leads to vit D deficiency (yet?), but it is theorically a possibility. Most people don't have to worry about wearing sunscreen 'too much'. But some people on this sub are obsessed with it, at a point where I think it can be detrimental to their mental health lmao.

I did say no studies have proven that sunscreen use decrease vit D absorption. I agree with you on this.

But sometimes I think the sun anxiety in this community is more associated with the fear of AGING than the fear of actually getting cancer. Some people use health as an 'excuse' while it's not really about health (not you obviously by all accounts). 

Vit D deficiency is real and widespread and have real consequences on health too. Way more people die of colorectal cancer than melanoma every year and I don't see people talking about taking fiber supplements as much as I see talking people talking about sunscreen on this app. Even though we have a 5% risk of getting colorectal cancer at some point in our lives. Probably because fibers don't make you look better and isn't pushed by the beauty industry...

Of course wearing sunscreen is important. I think making an effort of wearing sunscreen most of the time is enough, if you don't have a familial history of melanoma.

mue2jl7,Peshewa,"First, the risk of skin cancer and the photo aging doesn’t make it worth it to go the ‚natural‘ approach. You just need higher doses in your supplement. 

And now to why people with plenty of sun exposure can still be deficient: 

First reason I have to mention is auto-immune disorders. Thyroid problems can make it harder to sustain good vitamin D levels, but a lot of other diseases too. This is often overlooked and people with auto-immune disorders may need much higher maintenance doses than others. 

But back to the science of vitamin D: 
UVB rays let you produce vitamin D. 

You can and will produce vitamin D with sunscreen, since SPF isn’t doing a perfect job in blocking UVB rays. 
But depending on where you live you may only have UVB rays for a few months in the summertime - and the highest doses at noon and only outside in direct sunlight. 

So what blocks UVB: windows and clouds block UVB but not UVA. Sadly we can’t build vitamin D from UVA. 

What is bad for vitamin D production: our face, neck and hands, maybe lower arms, are the body parts that are most exposed in the sun. These are also the body parts that we wash the most frequent and washing them stops the creation and absorption of vitamin D. 

So in an ideal world for vitamin D production you’d need to be out at noon daily for like 10-20 minutes in direct sunlight during a time of the year where UVB rays are present. And you’d need to show your skin, preferably a lot of skin. And not wash your skin for hours after. Since this is not sustainable for most people with normal jobs and also comes with a higher risk of skin cancer and pre-mature skin aging the way easier route is to just use supplements. 

Oh, and I forgot to tell you about that UVA rays can also disturb the process of creating vitamin D in your skin 🙄 So it’s a mess really. And much safer to just wear the SPF that blocks UVA very good and UVB on an average level, get sun exposure with SPF regularly and take your supplements daily or weekly.",3,2025-05-26 21:10:26,FALSE,t1_muceeup,https://reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1kvtj7b/sun_care_my_vitamin_d_was_8_ngml_despite/mue2jl7/,FALSE,0,0

My partner for example works at the beach more than 1/2 the year and does not use sunscreen and has a vitamin D deficiency, whereas I tend to avoid the sun and slather myself in sunscreen and have no known deficiency. 

I am not like … compulsive about sun exposure. I will cover all the exposed areas I can anytime I know im gonna be out in direct sunlight for awhile, but day to day walking between subway and work I probably am not doing sunscreen on my arms and legs even if they’re uncovered. I also don’t like hats so generally unless I am planning to be in direct sunlight for prolonged periods I’m probably not gonna wear a hat or put sunscreen on my scalp. I do sit / walk under shade anytime I can, but it isn’t always possible. 

I think we overestimate how much we can really do with sunscreen anyway - even the most compulsive applier is going to miss SOMETHING and sunscreen is not a 100% guaranteed shield from the sun, so (and I admit I may be wrong, but) I think your issue is probably more just that you don’t spend enough time outside in general, not that you need to do less with sunscreen.

I took it with vitamin K3, magnesium and fatty food or a tablespoon of oil. 

There are vitamin d calculators available online where you can state your weight, age, vitamin d level, your preferred level you want to reach and in which time you want to reach it. It will give you the perfect daily dose to reach the level and should also give you a dose for vitamin K3 and preferably also magnesium. But K3 is most important. It also gives you a daily dose to hold your level. 

I can only link you calculators in my mother tongue but I’m sure they’re also available in english. 
I honestly would suggest to bring your levels up quickly since your deficiency is severe. I would set the time to reach the good level to a number of days that gives you 20.000 or 40.000iu daily. 
Btw my dose to hold my level is around 5000iu daily and I’m average size and weight for a woman. Therefore I’m pretty sure you’ll not be able to go to a good number with that daily dose of yours. 

Please don’t be afraid of doses like 20.000 or even 60.000iu. It’s not advised to take these daily over a longer period of time (like many weeks) when your levels are high enough or if you don’t know your level, but these are absolutely safe doses if you have a deficiency. Stay away from doses like 200.000iu or similar, these are also floating around the internet and they can be dangerous.

mudigpw,b4k4ni,"There is a slight misconception about the sun it seems. How long you can go out into the sun, depends a lot on your skin type and some other factors. Like time of the day and sun intensity.

First of all - do not wear SPF indoors and all the time. At least at home, if you go to work it's something different. That alone will help.

Also if you do small tasks outside, no SPF. I'm talking here about a short time frame. Depending on the skin type, some can do minutes and others an hour before issues arise.

Like taking the trash out, going around the corner or whatever. No SPF, show a bit of skin. To the sun.

You won't get a darker skin tone from it, but it will increase vitamin D production already by a lot. If this won't be enough, go out into the sun 2-3 times a day, early morning and evening when the sun is less intense for a few minutes. Like if you have a balcony, just sit outside for a few minutes.

That should be enough already.

It's not like your skin will be dark after a week or you will look like an old leather couch in 30 years. Your skin tone shouldn't change much with it. If you even have any change.

mud6w6k,Hitmanthe2nd,"ruining mental health with excessive worrying is a psychiatric issue - not a dermatological one and NOBODY tells you to use sunscreen every 2 hours when youre sitting in an office , it is specified that you need use it twice only when youre outdoors and getting constant exposure from the sun which causes photolysis of compounds in said sunscreen

the guy says that one would prefer basal cell carcinomas or squamous cell carcinomas over osteoporosis , now the issue with that statement is tenfold

first off , basal cell or squamous cell carcinomas are not life threatening generally but squamous cell can spread VERY rapidly and cause issues 

Secondly , they arent even your highest concerns - a melanoma is and studies have shown that a single sunburn can double your chances of getting one and if you work in healthcare - i dont have to tell you how grotesque melanomas are and how fast they spread

thirdly , vit d deficiency is not caused by sunscreen and a moderate deficiency is fixable with dietary changes \[obviously not the case here \] the guy is trying to make it seem like it ALWAYS causes osteoporosis which is just not the cause

osteoporosis in women is caused by lack of female sex corticoids , not by lack of vit d - if the other guy did not know this , he's either genuinely blinded by some agenda or just doesnt work in healthcare

fourth off , sunscreens are cheap - you need not use them daily on the dot , just use them when you go outside ; his entire argument is unfounded as it focuses on vit d synthesis being blocked by sunscreens

  
i agree , i was rude but ive had just about enough of people who claim to be in the healthcare industry and speak out of their asses or quote google like it's their god - osteoporosis has GREAT outcomes and can be prevented fairly easily if you go get a checkup once a year like you should anyway ; the guy preferring bcc or squamous carcinomas and even melanomas over it is insane and has inspired other people to do the same 

this will cause an increased stress on general practitioners and dermatologists who will now face another hundred people who use phrases like 'Such as various chemicals and hormones and so on. It’s a complicated process, I don’t have a detailed list memorized.' and dodge any opposition
