muq6ld7,gardenvariety_,"I got from 75 to 100 nmol/L (not ng/L) but it took a year. I was prescribed tablets but at some point changed to softgel capsules and within a few weeks of that change, I swear I felt better.

I was using Natures Plus softgels but brand may not matter. 

I’m in ireland so also get watery light most of the year and my doctor has told me that getting sun here in general is not going to help vitamin d much. She was delighted when I went on a trip to Australia as she said I’d finally get some proper vitamin D sunshine lol

A few thoughts on why their D-levels aren’t climbing as expected—and what they might try next:

1. Check for Absorption Issues

Gut health: Conditions like celiac, IBD or even low stomach acid can blunt fat-soluble vitamin uptake. A simple stool test for pancreatic elastase or a round of a digestive‐support protocol (e.g. betaine HCl, ox bile) might help.

Medications: Some anticonvulsants, glucocorticoids or even certain weight-loss drugs interfere with D absorption or conversion.



2. Body Composition & Storage

Adipose sequestration: Vitamin D is fat-soluble, so higher body-fat percentages can “lock away” more D in fat tissue. If they’re carrying extra body fat, they may simply need a higher dose to saturate those stores before serum levels rise.



3. Dose & Form Adjustment

Split dosing: Instead of one big 5 000 IU pill, try 2 500 IU twice daily (with each fatty meal) to maintain steadier blood levels.

D₂ vs. D₃: Though D₃ usually wins on efficacy, some people absorb D₂ better. A brief trial of a reputable D₂ supplement (e.g., ergocalciferol) could be informative.

Calcidiol (25(OH)D) prescription: In some countries doctors can prescribe the active circulating form, which bypasses the liver‐conversion step.



4. Magnesium & Co-Factors

Magnesium status: Even if supplementing, testing serum (and ideally RBC) magnesium can reveal subclinical deficiency. Magnesium is needed for both 25- and 1,25-hydroxylase activity.

Vitamin A & K₂: You need vitamin A (in balance) and K₂ to properly shuttle calcium once D levels rise. If they’re taking K₂, ensure the form is MK-7 at a bioactive dose (~100–200 μg/day).



5. Sunlight / UVB Therapy

UVB lamp: In northern latitudes winter sun often lacks UVB. A home UVB lamp (e.g., 280–315 nm) for just 5–10 minutes on arms/legs a few times a week can mimic summer sun production.

Safe sun scheduling: On brighter days, even a quick 10 min midday walk with face and arms exposed can yield 1 000–2 000 IU of natural D.



6. Rule Out Rare Genetic Causes

Vitamin D-binding protein (DBP) variants can lower “total” 25(OH)D readings while free D remains sufficient. A specialized panel can check DBP levels or free-D.



7. Re-Test & Track

After any change—higher/split dosing, UVB lamp, gut support—recheck at 8–12 weeks.

Keep a simple log: dose, meal type, sun exposure, gut-support protocol, and resulting levels. Patterns often emerge.





---

Bottom line: low response to D₃ supplements often comes down to absorption/storage or co-factor gaps. By layering in digestive support, tweaking dose and form, adding safe UVB exposure, and confirming magnesium/K status, they’ll have the best shot at bumping that 22 ng/mL well into the 40–60 ng/mL “optimal” range.",13,2025-05-28 18:27:47,TRUE,t3_1kxlbc9,https://reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1kxlbc9/vitamin_d_supplements_vs_15_minutes_of_sun_why_is/muq3oic/,FALSE,0,0

muq50db,dranaei,"I asked for a simpler response. Also be mindful, it does make mistakes. 

Here’s a super‐simple checklist your friend can try:

Split the Dose

Instead of one 5 000 IU pill, take 2 500 IU with breakfast and 2 500 IU with dinner.

Boost Absorption

Make sure it’s always with a fat-rich meal (e.g. avocado, cheese or olive oil).

If digestion is poor, try a basic digestive aid (a teaspoon of apple-cider vinegar before meals).

Add a UVB Lamp

In winter, natural sun in the Netherlands won’t cut it.

A 5–10 minute session, arms and legs uncovered, a few times a week can make a big difference.

Check Magnesium

Vitamin D needs magnesium to work.

If you haven’t tested it, a low-dose supplement (100–200 mg/day) can help levels rise.

After making one or two of these changes, re-test in 8–12 weeks. That should push you well into the “sufficient” range.",4,2025-05-28 18:34:27,FALSE,t1_muq4lml,https://reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1kxlbc9/vitamin_d_supplements_vs_15_minutes_of_sun_why_is/muq50db/,FALSE,0,0

murmuc8,redheadedalex,"Happy to answer all of these! So to be honest I kind of knew something was always wrong with me. I would have crippling stomach pains at school (but it's just anxiety!) and I would get sick after breakfast as a kid. I was also a very fussy unhappy baby and according to my mom I was never happy. I also had very very weak teeth, as a teen they just crumbled (but that was my fault for not brushing! OK?? But I did brush...  And my gums ALWAYS bled) when I was put in foster care they said I  was malnourished and should improve when on a proper diet. Too bad foster teens get fed ramen exclusively.... I was always on the verge of sick but not sick enough that anybody took me seriously. I got tested for all kinds of stuff, including heart failure and epilepsy. I had VERY bad pmdd and would actually attempt suicide at the same time of my cycle. I learned way later that this is very common in people with undiagnosed celiac, the constant cortisol and histamine levels make you literally truly feel crazy. I also tried to lose weight and succeeded when not eating carbs, but would get so sick on cheat days. Then I would be absolutely starving to the point hat I would binge which led to a dx of binge eating disorder. I was never full but always bloated or having diarrhea or constipation. 

But what led to me figuring it out ironically was me telling a friend that I thought HE had it due to his complexion (fair, gingerish) and when looking up symptoms I saw the hundreds that are related, and saw this rash that is more or less only celiac related. I can't remember the name of the rash but I've had it come and go since I was a kid. My mother swore it was from wearing rings even though I didn't have any rings 😂😂 if you Google celiac disease hand rash it'll come up.

I went gluten free for two days just to see if this might be a thing. I was gonna go longer but literally forgot and bit into a cupcake and within 20 minutes I was shitting my brains out. So I knew. I've met one or two people who DON'T have that response to gluten, rather they will get flu like symptoms a day or two after having it. My hypothesis is their immune response is slowed due to them being off gluten longer than I was.

So I figured it out myself. I was considering doign a blood test but those have a pretty high false negative rate and the only surefire way to know is endoscopy. I don't need that when like I say I get INSTANTLY sick around even tiny amounts of it. I felt different within days without it... My clarity was there, my mood stabilized. My heavy emotions were gone, insomnia gone, joint pain gone. Bloating gone... So many more. I've just continued to get more and more healthy since. And I get glutened every now and then and it fucking knocks me on my ass. Otherwise my immune system is great. I went back to this doctor after a year of no gluten and she was like ""oh my daughter has that too"" WOMAN??!!! HELLO??? I was fuming. THAT is the level of carelessness in the medical industry. Everything gets a pill and when the pill doesn't work it's your fault!!! Ridiculous. But she tested everything and within a year I was in normal levels. I still supplement here and there because I live in a place with very long winters, and I work inside sometimes.

Please be mindful of what and how you take. Some people mentioned that 10,0000 IU will be a good way to get your levels back up however look into D3+K2 because in this combo K2 will help the calcium from D3 to go into bones instead of joints and arteries.

muqduhh,VitaminDJesus,"I wouldn't worry too much about a comparison to your friend. Differences in color of skin, body fat, and the genetic roll of the dice can affect your ability to produce and metabolize vitamin D. They may even be taking their shirt off whereas you are not.

The simple answer to increase your level is to increase your dosage. Some people utilize higher doses, known as loading doses, to get to a higher level and then switch to a maintenance dose like 5K IU. If your body ""uses 5K IU"" every day, then it won't really raise your level, so the loading dose gives extra to build up your stores. You could take 20K IU for a couple months, and then, switch to 5K.

What do you want your vitamin D level to be?

The loading and maintenance dose approach has a shortcoming. It can be tricky to dial in because of the fact that vitamin D intake correlates with blood level on a curve, meaning that 10K IU will not increase your blood level twice as much as 5K. There are some thoughts that this is because more vitamin D is used by the body once the storage level of vitamin D increases. So, 20K for two months might get you to 50 ng/ml, and then 5K holds you there for six months, but then your level slowly starts to decrease and your level slides back down in a couple years.

Do you mind sharing your weight? A good rule of thumb is 100 IU per kg, but this may need to be 150-200 IU per kg for those that are obese as fat sequesters vitamin D.

You can pick a dose that gets you to your target level and consistently take that. If you see progress on your test, but it's too slow, then you can increase your dose. If you end up overshooting, then you can back off.

Given your test results, I would consider taking 15K IU daily, and retest in a couple months. You may simply have a genetic variation that requires you to supplement a higher amount.

Another possibility is that you have a malabsorption issue. You can bypass the gut by putting the vitamin D oil under your tongue and letting it absorb. Either poke a hole in a softgel, and squirt it under your tongue or buy a liquid product in a dropper. So, if you try 15K IU for two months, and your level is not noticeably different, then you might switch to sublingual.",1,2025-05-28 19:18:06,TRUE,t3_1kxlbc9,https://reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1kxlbc9/vitamin_d_supplements_vs_15_minutes_of_sun_why_is/muqduhh/,FALSE,0,0
muqrojz,VitaminDJesus,"I respond well to supplements and take 10K IU daily. This, combined with some sun exposure, keeps me around the upper end of the reference range. I've played around with different doses, but I actually should get another test here soon to help track my long term progress.

My main point in describing different approaches is to equip you to make the best decisions for yourself. Different people have different capacities for following the details of a protocol and doing follow up testing.

I think the simplest approach is to take a consistent dose every day that will bring a level up to target and maintain it. Based on your results taking 5K IU for 8 months, I think you will need 15K to get and stay above 50 ng/ml. That is not factoring in the option of sublingual dosing if you have an absorption issue.

If you'd like to be cautious or more methodical, then increase to 10K, and retest in a month. You could even try 10K and do it sublingually to increase your chances of figuring it out sooner. In other words, you should expect to see a decent jump in your level with that combo. If you wanted to really isolate the malabsorption part, then that's another month and another test.
